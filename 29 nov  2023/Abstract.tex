\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis we are interested in the enumeration of polyominoes and forests of polyominoes inscribed in a rectangle of any width and height according to parameters such as the area, the perimeter, the number of leaves and the number of connected components.

 More precisely, let $B$ be a non-zero natural number and $R_{B}$ the family of rectangles of width $B$ and  integer height. We build automata $\mathcal{A}_{B}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$ whose paths are in bijection respectively with the polyominoes and the forests of polyominoes inscribed in the rectangles of $R_{ B}$. We construct the transition matrix with respect to each of the automata from which and from the theorems guaranteeing the polyomino is inscribed in a rectangle of $R_{B}$. We enumerate all the polyominoes and the forests of polyominoes inscribed in these types of rectangles. 
 
 To achieve our goals, we establish several formulas related to combinatorics in particular, the formulas allowing the determination of area, perimeter, the number of leaves and the number of connected components exchanged during a transition of one state to another. We present in detail the cases $B=2$ and $B=3$.
